The spacious cabin, panoramic view, quiet environment, and form-fitting seats all combine to create total traveling comfort.  Since the dawn of aviation, designers have been trying to create a seaplane that would fly as fast and as far as a land plane and carry a reasonable useful load over a long distance.  Using advanced composite technology and innovative design, Seawind has accomplished that lofty goal. High speed stability is superb.  The standard slotted flaps and the swept back wingtip floats (sponsons) create an extraordinary ground effect, cushions the touchdown, and speeds the lift-off on water and land.  Low speed stability is excellent.  Never before has an amphibian offered so much comfort.  The Seawind has the widest cabin in its class, with the standard executive deluxe four-place configuration or the optional family five-place seating.  The seats are bucket-style adjustable with temper foam for ultimate comfort.  The special designed seats have passed the stringent 26g forward and 19g - 60°up vertical crash tests. The wrap-around windshield offers a spectacular panoramic view even for the aft seats.

UNIVERSAL TRANSPORT SYSTEMS LLC,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/universal-transport-systems-llc,"Chicago, Illinois, United States","Universal Transport Systems is dedicated to bringing human spaceflight down to Earth. To accomplish this goal we are creating a near single stage to orbit spacecraft that operates similar to a light airplane; requiring only a very small team to launch. Our key technological differentiators include a unique solid propellant rocket engine that is throttleable, stoppable, and in-flight restartable; as well as a pressure stabilized ""inflatable"" vehicle design. Combined with the pressure stabilized vehicle, the engine allows for incredibly high propellant mass fractions.  The engine and propellant design dramatically improves safety while reducing launch costs. In order to monetize this new industry which we are creating, we will make most of our money through propellant sales; as repeat business is the most reliable revenue stream. Several years ago we started with a handful of novel ideas and began prototyping.  Today we have an engine system, two full scale vehicles in testing, and a portfolio of patentable, patent pending, and patented technology. Our next step is to enter the DARPA Launch Challenge (we have already perqualified), where we will be given $400K to continue development, and up to $12M more if we make our orbital launch goals.",Active,For Profit,Non-equity Assistance,,2007-01-01,day,"Aerospace, Space Travel"
