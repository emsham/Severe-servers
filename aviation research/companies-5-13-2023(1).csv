D² Products provided hundreds of display systems, equipment and services to major airlines and airports, including Delta Air Lines and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The company changed its name to Infax, Inc. in 1985 to align itself with its key product known as the “Infax” system. In the early 1990s, Infax, Inc. made the strategic decision to phase out manufacturing operations and instead specialize in system design integration, which continues to be a main focus of the company today. Based on feedback from airport clients, Infax entered the judicial market in the mid-1990s with DocketCall®, its flagship solution for courts. Since the initial installation, Infax has installed its judicial solutions in more than 200 different courthouses across North America. In recent years, Infax began incorporating analytics into its solutions to give customers insight into their day-to-day operations. With the ability to analyze data, customers can see where improvements are needed and what they can do to be more efficient.
