Or skip the meeting altogether, and be on the slopes in Tahoe by 8:40 AM for $100 round-trip, and back home the same evening. We are a land of towns and communities, many with airports, but few with regular air service. Our stock of 13,500 airports is the largest in the world, yet just 140 of the largest hubs carry over 97% of air traffic. This has left many of us with long drives to catch a flight, while on shorter trips we skip air travel altogether. Communities without good air service also struggle to attract investment and create jobs. Electric aircraft of varying sizes are ideally suited to this critical need, requiring little support other than a GPS flight path and a quick recharge or swap facility on the tarmac. Be it Moses Lake, Beaumont, Santa Fe or Butte: prepare for the convenience of frequent electric air service. Did you know that short-haul flights produce over 40% of aviation emissions? With our aircraft, we believe these will be largely eliminated within twenty years.

GoTek Energy, Inc. develops, manufactures, and licenses clean technology, yet fuel agnostic, rotary (non-Wankel) internal combustion engines that propel all types of land, water, and air transportation as well as drive stationary power generation devices to produce electricity, compressed air, vacuum, and heat exchange plus power industrial equipment. GoTek’s DynaKinetic™ rotary engines (which are not Wankel engines) run on clean natural gas or propane to reduce harmful emissions and can also run on a second common fuel to increase the mileage range or run time. GoTek’s piston-free rotary engine design converts clean and standard fuels into energy more efficiently than traditional engines, by eliminating much of the mechanical complexity (and associated energy loss) of piston-based engines and does so with increased performance. GoTek Energy, Inc. will also develop, manufacture, and license rotary multi-stage capable compressors to pressurize and flow gases for directly creating compressed air and heat exchange and pumps to flow liquids and enable fluid transfer which are both leveraged from the engine technology. GoTek’s DynaKinetic™ rotary compressors and pumps flow significantly more gas or liquid per revolution and achieve this performance in a reduced size and weight package.",Active,For Profit,,Women Founded,2011-02-23,day,"Air Transportation, Automotive, Drones, Energy Efficiency, Manufacturing, Marine Transportation, Transportation"

Current UAVs provide short-duration services due to inherent limitations of fuel and weather-constrained flight. Titan’s solar-powered atmosats can fly perpetually up to five years above the weather. Unlike traditional orbiting satellites, which cost upwards of $1.0B to design, outfit, launch, and operate, Titan can outfit its atmosats with a 70 lb+ payload, and launch and be operational within days and at a fraction of the cost. As battery technologies, communications technologies and imaging technologies improve, Titan can land, upgrade and relaunch each of its atmosats thereby ensuring the most effective payload services.

Crewed missions to Mars will follow, moving humanity closer to becoming a multi-planetary species. Pushing towards this next frontier, we are deeply curious about the questions that will arise and the transformative potential that will touch the lives of all of us. While there are extreme technological challenges, we will equally be challenged by questions about how to live beyond our home planet. This includes questions of culture, identity, consciousness, and the everyday mundane experience of being human. Barrelhand is exploring these questions by creating products that are uniquely designed to meet the requirements of human life in space. We understand ourselves as a platform for innovation that is open to technologists, scientists and artists who are prepared to bring their insights towards this mission. Our journey started in 2014 with a limited edition timepiece called Project One, which explored and demonstrated the potential of additive manufacturing (3D-printing) for mechanical watchmaking. More than a watch, Project One has been a pioneer and research outlet for an upcoming technology that offers vast, yet largely unrealized potential. At the moment, we are developing our next-generation product line and infrastructure, which will include an array of cutting-edge technologies and insights to meet the harsh requirements of space.
