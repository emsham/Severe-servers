Our business strategy relies on three core components (launch services, cubesat hardware and software) which allow us to provide a true turnkey, end-to-end space utilization solution. Realization of our vision relies on successful development of the Helios cubesat-class launch vehicle. The Helios nanolaunch system is a three-stage vertical launch vehicle with liquid propulsion in the first two stages and a solid propellant third stage. The design utilizes common propellants in the first two stages and a common engine design with nozzles optimized for altitude in a “plug cluster” aerospike configuration. Phoenix utilizes a unique hydrogen peroxide-based hypergolic propellant that eliminates the need for a separate ignition system but also is non-toxic, non-carcinogenic and the exhaust products are environmentally-friendly. This propellant family was fully developed and hot-fire qualified by Aphelion Orbitals, Inc. in 2018. We further matured the technology into Aphelion Aerospace's proprietary propellant mixture. The first stage is designed to be reusable using boostback, powered descent and vertical landing. Helios will be completely mobile and not rely on any fixed infrastructure, launch pad or processing facilities. The vehicle will be able to remain fully fueled for hours to days before launch and launch on short notice (2-3 days) after arrival at the launch site. Our launch service provides a number of key competencies: dedicated launch, custom orbital insertion, low cost, and a very short lead time. We target the following use customer types: * Commercial customers desiring rapid, guaranteed launch * Clients requiring a method of deployment and maintaining large nanosatellite constellations for communications, resource identification, and monitoring * Missions demanding specific orbits inaccessible through rideshare * Time-sensitive missions which require quick turnaround to launch * Spacecraft that need to be powered on and/or monitored real-time before deployment * Clients desiring to launch spacecraft with irregular volume and mass envelopes Aphelion Aerospace pursues an innovative launch service business model: * Our launch services are sold in a manner similar to airline ticketing * Regularly scheduled launches are provided to defined orbital inclinations * 30 days from cubesat acceptance to launch * “Gas and go” on-demand capability for dedicated launches on short notice * Full up-front price disclosure and guaranteed",Active,For Profit,Equity Crowdfunding,,2019-03-23,day,"Aerospace, Space Travel"

Skyhaven seeks out high risk development areas via responding to competitive solicitations and securing government funded contracts and grants. These contracts enable the firm to innovate and develop new technologies to solve government identified problems culminating in the delivery of research reports, operational prototypes, or a limited number of operational systems for use by the government. As a small business, Skyhaven owns the technology rights to its government funded research and development projects.

"GovBizConnect, Inc.",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/govbizconnect-com,"Washington, District of Columbia, United States","GovBizConnect is an online professional network for government contracting professionals. It enables users—both government contractors and employees—to build tailored profiles in order to identify teaming and contracting opportunities based on capabilities, certifications, past performance, and other criteria.    Co-founder and CEO, Tom Skypek, who formerly worked for federal contractors Booz Allen Hamilton and SAIC in Washington, D.C., says his company is focused on solving a major pain point for government contracting professionals. “They’re a true business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-government (B2G) social network. They’re the Match.com for government contractors. Looking for a woman-owned business with expertise in environmental consulting? Or a veteran-owned business with expertise in cloud computing? GovBizConnect is your solution.”   Government contractors are able to build tailored profiles based on their unique capabilities and certifications. Government employees such as contracting officers are able to build profiles and search for qualified small businesses. GovBizConnect features 40+ data fields, real-time activity stream, private messaging, and a mobile-friendly design.    The CT-based startup has been signing up users since April of this year. “They’ve been hearing from small government contractors, large primes, and government contracting officers—all of whom are looking for a better way to find teaming partners and contracting opportunities,” explains co-founder and CTO, Chris Malinoski, who earned his PhD from UConn.    Co-founders Skypek and Malinoski grew up together in Connecticut and decided to start GovBizConnect after Skypek returned from Washington, D.C. “I saw firsthand how difficult it was to finding great teaming partners and wanted to solve that problem. It’s 2015 and there’s no reason that the process can’t be more data-driven and streamlined. If they modernize this process, the companies win, the government wins, and so does the taxpayer. That’s why they started GovBizConnect.”",Active,For Profit,Seed,,2015-02-01,day,"Aerospace, Business Development, National Security, SaaS"
