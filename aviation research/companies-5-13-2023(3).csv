"AEi Systems, LLC",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aei-systems-llc,"Los Angeles, California, United States","AEi Systems is a United States space and power electronics engineering firm based in Denver, Colorado with a presence in Henderson, Nevada and an analysis and testing facility in Los Angeles, California. AEi Systems is most well known for its analysis of space-bound and other industrial power supplies and power systems -- especially those that must operate reliably under extreme conditions (such as radiation, magnetic fields, heat, and the like) and yet also keep within size and weight limitations. AEi Systems is the world leader in Worst Case Circuit Analysis (WCCA) and failure and reliability analysis for space-bound DC-DC converters. The company also acts as a supplier of highly specialized radiation-hardened power supplies and related power system circuitry. The company was founded in 2002, and its predecessor, Analytical Engineering, Inc., was founded in 1995.  The company has four, inter-related business lines: * Analysis: Worst Case Circuit Analysis (WCCA) and failure and reliability analyses. * SPICE Modeling: Modeling of complex ICs for major manufacturers and to support AEi Systems analysis and design work. * Software: Sale of licensed copies of (i) the company's Power IC Model Library for PSpice, and (ii) certain WCCA templates and tables. * Design: Design and licensing or sale of space-bound and other industrial power supplies and related power system circuitry. Noteworthy achievements and facts: * Motorola University's ""six sigma class"" on worst case analysis was created by AEi Systems * The failing design of the LVPS power supply for the Atlas Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator) was revised and upgraded by AEi Systems * Most SPICE models for Power ICs that electrical engineers find on the Internet were created by AEi Systems, including those found on the websites of ON Semiconductor and Texas Instruments and those used via National Semiconductor's online Webench tool * AEi Systems analyzed the power buss for the International Space Station Defense and Aerospace Projects AEi Systems has been involved in the development and analysis of some of the most sophisticated and technically challenging power systems in the world, both in the space and defense arena and also with respect to commercial and industrial applications. The company has provided computer simulation models and worst case circuit analysis on most projects. Many projects are ""dark"" but among the company's publicly-known projects are: BSAT, CMIS, Globalstar, GMI, Goes, GPS, HS-702, Intellsat, Juno, MCI, Milstar, MSV, MUOS. NPOESS, Omegasat, P1196, P-81, SMMA, SMU, Spaceway, Tempo, Virgo, XPC Commercial and Scientific Projects  AEi Systems' power supply analysis and design expertise has also been sought for commercial and industrial projects not involving space or defense. For example, AEi Systems worked on the following projects (we can name): The upgrading and revision of the failing design of the LVPS power supply for the Atlas Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator that ""uncovered"" the Higgs Boson) Darwin (Schilling Robotics), a 100kW Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle (ROV) that operates underneath the North Sea under 17 kPSI at over 6 kM; and  Commercial projects for Bosch, DeLL and EMC. SPICE Modeling AEi Systems provides SPICE models to many major IC manufacturers, including Texas Instruments, ON Semiconductor and National Semiconductor. Many can be seen on (and downloaded from) their websites.  Since 2005, this business unit has produced and distributed the Power IC Model Library for PSpice, which is distributed by Cadence's sole North American distributor (EMA-EDA) in the United States and Canada, and by other major distributors in Asia and Europe.",Active,For Profit,,,1995-01-01,year,Aerospace
