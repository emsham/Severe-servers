NASA,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nasa,"Washington, District of Columbia, United States","NASA's vision is to reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind. President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958, partially in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite the previous year. NASA grew out of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA), which had been researching flight technology for more than 40 years. President John F. Kennedy focused NASA and the nation on sending astronauts to the moon by the end of the 1960s. Through the Mercury and Gemini projects, NASA developed the technology and skills it needed for the journey. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first of 12 men to walk on the moon, meeting Kennedy's challenge. Meanwhile, NASA was continuing the aeronautics research pioneered by NACA. It also conducted purely scientific research and worked on developing applications for space technology, combining both pursuits in developing the first weather and communications satellites. After Apollo, NASA focused on creating a reusable ship to provide regular access to space: the space shuttle. First launched in 1981, the space shuttle flew more than 130 successful flights before retiring in 2011. In 2000, the United States and Russia established permanent human presence in space aboard the International Space Station, a multinational project representing the work of 16 nations. NASA also has continued its scientific research. In 1997, Mars Pathfinder became the first in a fleet of spacecraft that will explore Mars in the next decade, as we try to determine if life ever existed there. The Terra and Aqua satellites are flagships of a different fleet, this one in Earth orbit, designed to help us understand how our home world is changing. NASA's aeronautics teams are focused on improved aircraft travel that is safer and cleaner. Throughout its history, NASA has conducted or funded research that has led to numerous improvements to life here on Earth.",Active,For Profit,,,1958-07-29,day,"Aerospace, National Security, Robotics, Space Travel"

With retired Air Force Brigadier General Dick Lassiter serving as president and chairman of the board – not to mention founding partners such as entertainers James Stewart and Arthur Godfrey – They were in quite capable hands right from the start. And They’ve been pioneers ever since. In 1984, when Richard Santulli purchased EJA and created the NetJets program – and with it, the concept of fractional ownership – They truly cemented Their place in the record books. In the following years, They grew steadily and constantly looked for new ways to ensure They provided the best safety and service for Their Owners: new aircraft, new facilities, new global programs. In 1995, Warren Buffett joined NetJets as a customer; by 1998, he was so impressed with the operation that he bought the company, adding it to the Berkshire Hathaway empire. From then on, with Berkshire’s backing, NetJets has had unmatched resources to invest in whatever it takes to always be the best and safest player in the industry. Today, NetJets continues to uniquely and expertly fill a crucial need – helping Their Owners save time in order to take care of what’s most important in their lives. And as They nurture a nascent operation in China, add state-of-the-art Signature Series™ aircraft worldwide, and take any and all steps to provide the most seamless and enjoyable travel experience possible, you can bet that They will continue to live up to Their promise.",Active,For Profit,,,1964-01-01,year,"Aerospace, In-Flight Entertainment, Privacy"

AlliedSignal Inc.,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/alliedsignal-inc,"Mishawaka, Indiana, United States","AlliedSignal is a leading manufacturer of aerospace systems and components that later merged with Honeywell International, Inc., in 1999. The corporation was formed in 1920 in the consolidation of several chemical manufacturers. By 1928, Allied became the leading producer of ammonia in the world with the opening of its plant near Hopewell, Virginia. Post World War II, Allied continued to venture into new markets with the production of nylon 6 (used in manufacturing items from tires to clothing) and refrigerants. In 1958, Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation moved its headquarters to Morristown, New Jersey where it was renamed Allied Chemical Corporation. In the 1940s these companies were transformed into divisions of Allied Chemical. There were further reorganizations and acquisitions of companies and plants during the 1950s, ’60s, and ’70s, and Allied became a conglomerate. Taking the name Allied Corporation in 1981, the firm acquired the Bendix Corporation, a manufacturer of automotive and aerospace equipment, in 1983.  Known as Allied-Signal in 1985, Allied expanded its aerospace, automotive, and engineered materials businesses through its merger with the Signal Companies. In 1993 the hyphen was dropped from the company’s name to convey a one-company image. In 1986 Allied-Signal spun off about 35 of its diverse subsidiary operations into a new and separate company so that the parent corporation, renamed AlliedSignal in 1993, could concentrate on its growing aerospace electronics and automotive operations.  In 1999, AlliedSignal acquired Honeywell—an international controls company that developed and supplied advanced technology products, systems, and services to aviation and space companies and industry—and adopted its name which it considered to be more recognizable. This merger was valued at $15 billion.  Today, with headquarters in Morristown, New Jersey and over 122,000 employees worldwide, Honeywell is organized into four major business units: aerospace, automation and control solutions, transportation systems, and specialty materials.",Active,For Profit,,,1920-01-01,year,"Aerospace, Automotive, Innovation Management, Manufacturing"

Goodyear Aerospace,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/goodyear-aerospace,"Akron, Ohio, United States","The founding date for Goodyear Aerospace Corporation was listed here on www.crunchbase.com  as 1987.  I knew this was incorrect because my father, Robert C. Nelson,  worked for Goodyear Aerospace Corporation, a subsidiary of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company.  Our family moved from Detroit, Michigan where Dad's work had to do with tires for automobiles to the Los Angeles area where his new job at Goodyear was in aerospace.   We moved the summer of 1957.  I remember celebrating my June birthday at a motel in Los Angeles where we lived temporarily until our new home was built and ready later that summer.  I read on Wikipedia that the Goodyear Zeppelin Corp. built rigid airships in conjunction with Germany until the relationship between the U.S. and Germany deteriorated prior to World War II.  So in 1939 the Goodyear Aircraft Company dissociated itself from Germany and became its own entity.  In the post-World War II era as Goodyear Aircraft Company's products diversified, especially in terms of radar systems, it became the Goodyear Aerospace Corporation in 1963.",Active,For Profit,,,1924-01-01,year,Aerospace

As a result of Al’s innovation, pilots continue to have the ability to control and monitor their engine’s fuel-air ratio. In 1965, Alcor patented the key component of the EGT system, the durable thermocouple, which remains one of Alcor’s most popular products today. Al’s son, Michael Hundere, continues the family tradition of manufacturing the highest quality products for all piston-powered aircraft. Are you investing in a first-class aircraft with a top-of-the-line engine monitoring system?
