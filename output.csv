Our business strategy relies on three core components (launch services, cubesat hardware and software) which allow us to provide a true turnkey, end-to-end space utilization solution. Realization of our vision relies on successful development of the Helios cubesat-class launch vehicle. The Helios nanolaunch system is a three-stage vertical launch vehicle with liquid propulsion in the first two stages and a solid propellant third stage. The design utilizes common propellants in the first two stages and a common engine design with nozzles optimized for altitude in a “plug cluster” aerospike configuration. Phoenix utilizes a unique hydrogen peroxide-based hypergolic propellant that eliminates the need for a separate ignition system but also is non-toxic, non-carcinogenic and the exhaust products are environmentally-friendly. This propellant family was fully developed and hot-fire qualified by Aphelion Orbitals, Inc. in 2018. We further matured the technology into Aphelion Aerospace's proprietary propellant mixture. The first stage is designed to be reusable using boostback, powered descent and vertical landing. Helios will be completely mobile and not rely on any fixed infrastructure, launch pad or processing facilities. The vehicle will be able to remain fully fueled for hours to days before launch and launch on short notice (2-3 days) after arrival at the launch site. Our launch service provides a number of key competencies: dedicated launch, custom orbital insertion, low cost, and a very short lead time. We target the following use customer types: * Commercial customers desiring rapid, guaranteed launch * Clients requiring a method of deployment and maintaining large nanosatellite constellations for communications, resource identification, and monitoring * Missions demanding specific orbits inaccessible through rideshare * Time-sensitive missions which require quick turnaround to launch * Spacecraft that need to be powered on and/or monitored real-time before deployment * Clients desiring to launch spacecraft with irregular volume and mass envelopes Aphelion Aerospace pursues an innovative launch service business model: * Our launch services are sold in a manner similar to airline ticketing * Regularly scheduled launches are provided to defined orbital inclinations * 30 days from cubesat acceptance to launch * “Gas and go” on-demand capability for dedicated launches on short notice * Full up-front price disclosure and guaranteed",Active,For Profit,Equity Crowdfunding,,2019-03-23,day,"Aerospace, Space Travel"

Skyhaven seeks out high risk development areas via responding to competitive solicitations and securing government funded contracts and grants. These contracts enable the firm to innovate and develop new technologies to solve government identified problems culminating in the delivery of research reports, operational prototypes, or a limited number of operational systems for use by the government. As a small business, Skyhaven owns the technology rights to its government funded research and development projects.

"GovBizConnect, Inc.",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/govbizconnect-com,"Washington, District of Columbia, United States","GovBizConnect is an online professional network for government contracting professionals. It enables users—both government contractors and employees—to build tailored profiles in order to identify teaming and contracting opportunities based on capabilities, certifications, past performance, and other criteria.    Co-founder and CEO, Tom Skypek, who formerly worked for federal contractors Booz Allen Hamilton and SAIC in Washington, D.C., says his company is focused on solving a major pain point for government contracting professionals. “They’re a true business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-government (B2G) social network. They’re the Match.com for government contractors. Looking for a woman-owned business with expertise in environmental consulting? Or a veteran-owned business with expertise in cloud computing? GovBizConnect is your solution.”   Government contractors are able to build tailored profiles based on their unique capabilities and certifications. Government employees such as contracting officers are able to build profiles and search for qualified small businesses. GovBizConnect features 40+ data fields, real-time activity stream, private messaging, and a mobile-friendly design.    The CT-based startup has been signing up users since April of this year. “They’ve been hearing from small government contractors, large primes, and government contracting officers—all of whom are looking for a better way to find teaming partners and contracting opportunities,” explains co-founder and CTO, Chris Malinoski, who earned his PhD from UConn.    Co-founders Skypek and Malinoski grew up together in Connecticut and decided to start GovBizConnect after Skypek returned from Washington, D.C. “I saw firsthand how difficult it was to finding great teaming partners and wanted to solve that problem. It’s 2015 and there’s no reason that the process can’t be more data-driven and streamlined. If they modernize this process, the companies win, the government wins, and so does the taxpayer. That’s why they started GovBizConnect.”",Active,For Profit,Seed,,2015-02-01,day,"Aerospace, Business Development, National Security, SaaS"

NASA,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nasa,"Washington, District of Columbia, United States","NASA's vision is to reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind. President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958, partially in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite the previous year. NASA grew out of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA), which had been researching flight technology for more than 40 years. President John F. Kennedy focused NASA and the nation on sending astronauts to the moon by the end of the 1960s. Through the Mercury and Gemini projects, NASA developed the technology and skills it needed for the journey. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first of 12 men to walk on the moon, meeting Kennedy's challenge. Meanwhile, NASA was continuing the aeronautics research pioneered by NACA. It also conducted purely scientific research and worked on developing applications for space technology, combining both pursuits in developing the first weather and communications satellites. After Apollo, NASA focused on creating a reusable ship to provide regular access to space: the space shuttle. First launched in 1981, the space shuttle flew more than 130 successful flights before retiring in 2011. In 2000, the United States and Russia established permanent human presence in space aboard the International Space Station, a multinational project representing the work of 16 nations. NASA also has continued its scientific research. In 1997, Mars Pathfinder became the first in a fleet of spacecraft that will explore Mars in the next decade, as we try to determine if life ever existed there. The Terra and Aqua satellites are flagships of a different fleet, this one in Earth orbit, designed to help us understand how our home world is changing. NASA's aeronautics teams are focused on improved aircraft travel that is safer and cleaner. Throughout its history, NASA has conducted or funded research that has led to numerous improvements to life here on Earth.",Active,For Profit,,,1958-07-29,day,"Aerospace, National Security, Robotics, Space Travel"

NetJets,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/netjets,"Columbus, Ohio, United States","NetJets Two decades after making an indelible mark on human history in World War II, three retired military pilots set out to change the course of aviation history. It was fifty years ago, 1964, that U.S. Air Force Generals Curtis LeMay and Paul Tibbets, with U.S. Army Air Corpsman Bruce Sundlun, partnered to give birth to NetJets’ forerunner, Executive Jet Aviation, one of the world’s first aircraft management businesses. With retired Air Force Brigadier General Dick Lassiter serving as president and chairman of the board – not to mention founding partners such as entertainers James Stewart and Arthur Godfrey – They were in quite capable hands right from the start. And They’ve been pioneers ever since. In 1984, when Richard Santulli purchased EJA and created the NetJets program – and with it, the concept of fractional ownership – They truly cemented Their place in the record books. In the following years, They grew steadily and constantly looked for new ways to ensure They provided the best safety and service for Their Owners: new aircraft, new facilities, new global programs. In 1995, Warren Buffett joined NetJets as a customer; by 1998, he was so impressed with the operation that he bought the company, adding it to the Berkshire Hathaway empire. From then on, with Berkshire’s backing, NetJets has had unmatched resources to invest in whatever it takes to always be the best and safest player in the industry. Today, NetJets continues to uniquely and expertly fill a crucial need – helping Their Owners save time in order to take care of what’s most important in their lives. And as They nurture a nascent operation in China, add state-of-the-art Signature Series™ aircraft worldwide, and take any and all steps to provide the most seamless and enjoyable travel experience possible, you can bet that They will continue to live up to Their promise.",Active,For Profit,,,1964-01-01,year,"Aerospace, In-Flight Entertainment, Privacy"

AlliedSignal Inc.,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/alliedsignal-inc,"Mishawaka, Indiana, United States","AlliedSignal is a leading manufacturer of aerospace systems and components that later merged with Honeywell International, Inc., in 1999.

By 1928, Allied became the leading producer of ammonia in the world with the opening of its plant near Hopewell, Virginia. Post World War II, Allied continued to venture into new markets with the production of nylon 6 (used in manufacturing items from tires to clothing) and refrigerants. In 1958, Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation moved its headquarters to Morristown, New Jersey where it was renamed Allied Chemical Corporation. In the 1940s these companies were transformed into divisions of Allied Chemical. There were further reorganizations and acquisitions of companies and plants during the 1950s, ’60s, and ’70s, and Allied became a conglomerate. Taking the name Allied Corporation in 1981, the firm acquired the Bendix Corporation, a manufacturer of automotive and aerospace equipment, in 1983.  Known as Allied-Signal in 1985, Allied expanded its aerospace, automotive, and engineered materials businesses through its merger with the Signal Companies. In 1993 the hyphen was dropped from the company’s name to convey a one-company image. In 1986 Allied-Signal spun off about 35 of its diverse subsidiary operations into a new and separate company so that the parent corporation, renamed AlliedSignal in 1993, could concentrate on its growing aerospace electronics and automotive operations.  In 1999, AlliedSignal acquired Honeywell—an international controls company that developed and supplied advanced technology products, systems, and services to aviation and space companies and industry—and adopted its name which it considered to be more recognizable. This merger was valued at $15 billion.  Today, with headquarters in Morristown, New Jersey and over 122,000 employees worldwide, Honeywell is organized into four major business units: aerospace, automation and control solutions, transportation systems, and specialty materials.",Active,For Profit,,,1920-01-01,year,"Aerospace, Automotive, Innovation Management, Manufacturing"

I remember celebrating my June birthday at a motel in Los Angeles where we lived temporarily until our new home was built and ready later that summer.  I read on Wikipedia that the Goodyear Zeppelin Corp. built rigid airships in conjunction with Germany until the relationship between the U.S. and Germany deteriorated prior to World War II.  So in 1939 the Goodyear Aircraft Company dissociated itself from Germany and became its own entity.  In the post-World War II era as Goodyear Aircraft Company's products diversified, especially in terms of radar systems, it became the Goodyear Aerospace Corporation in 1963.",Active,For Profit,,,1924-01-01,year,Aerospace

In 1965, Alcor patented the key component of the EGT system, the durable thermocouple, which remains one of Alcor’s most popular products today. Al’s son, Michael Hundere, continues the family tradition of manufacturing the highest quality products for all piston-powered aircraft.

AirCharter.com & FlightTime,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/flighttime,"Boston, Massachusetts, United States","FlightTime.com, formerly Flight Time Corporation, becomes The Global Aviation Network with the acquisition of Wyvern Ltd. and Mach-1. Since 1985, FlightTime.com has specialized in providing premium air charter to travelers worldwide. FlightTime.com’s expert knowledge of global air transportation has made us the leading provider of air charter services worldwide. FlightTime.com’s extensive presence with offices in Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Atlanta, Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles, London, Amsterdam, Bremen, and Milan puts us in a unique position to ensure that even the most complex travel missions, whether domestic or international, are a success. LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, February 2, 2000 Flight Time Corporation, the global leader in air charter, today announced it will acquire Wyvern Ltd., an industry-leading safety and compliance auditing firm, and MACH-1 Software Corporation, a provider of aviation enterprise management software, and rename the company FlightTime.com. FlightTime.com will leverage the well-known safety and superior technology components associated with Wyvern and MACH-1 with the company’s existing e-commerce site AirCharter.com to create the first, audited global aviation network. FlightTime.com also announced it has received substantial financial backing from Southeast Interactive Technology Funds (SEI) and BancBoston Ventures to fund the company’s rapid growth, extensive future technology investments and commitment toward the marketing and distribution of charter going forward. “Until now, the charter industry has lacked a single one-stop resource to find and book aircraft from an aviation network, ” said Robert McBride, president of FlightTime.com. “With these acquisitions and new funds, FlightTime.com will integrate global supply and distribution to create an “end-to-end” network built on a single platform, providing real-time access to a global fleet of audited aircraft residing on a single, intelligent system via the Internet.” The acquisition of Wyvern Ltd. is one component of FlightTime.com’s move to create a seamless and fully integrated solution for the aviation industry by using the company’s extensive expertise and objective information on the safety, quality and service of specific aircraft and operators on four continents.

"AEi Systems, LLC",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aei-systems-llc,"Los Angeles, California, United States","AEi Systems is a United States space and power electronics engineering firm based in Denver, Colorado with a presence in Henderson, Nevada and an analysis and testing facility in Los Angeles, California. AEi Systems is most well known for its analysis of space-bound and other industrial power supplies and power systems -- especially those that must operate reliably under extreme conditions (such as radiation, magnetic fields, heat, and the like) and yet also keep within size and weight limitations. AEi Systems is the world leader in Worst Case Circuit Analysis (WCCA) and failure and reliability analysis for space-bound DC-DC converters. The company also acts as a supplier of highly specialized radiation-hardened power supplies and related power system circuitry. The company was founded in 2002, and its predecessor, Analytical Engineering, Inc., was founded in 1995.  The company has four, inter-related business lines: * Analysis: Worst Case Circuit Analysis (WCCA) and failure and reliability analyses. * SPICE Modeling: Modeling of complex ICs for major manufacturers and to support AEi Systems analysis and design work. * Software: Sale of licensed copies of (i) the company's Power IC Model Library for PSpice, and (ii) certain WCCA templates and tables. * Design: Design and licensing or sale of space-bound and other industrial power supplies and related power system circuitry. Noteworthy achievements and facts: * Motorola University's ""six sigma class"" on worst case analysis was created by AEi Systems * The failing design of the LVPS power supply for the Atlas Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator) was revised and upgraded by AEi Systems * Most SPICE models for Power ICs that electrical engineers find on the Internet were created by AEi Systems, including those found on the websites of ON Semiconductor and Texas Instruments and those used via National Semiconductor's online Webench tool * AEi Systems analyzed the power buss for the International Space Station Defense and Aerospace Projects AEi Systems has been involved in the development and analysis of some of the most sophisticated and technically challenging power systems in the world, both in the space and defense arena and also with respect to commercial and industrial applications. The company has provided computer simulation models and worst case circuit analysis on most projects. Many projects are ""dark"" but among the company's publicly-known projects are: BSAT, CMIS, Globalstar, GMI, Goes, GPS, HS-702, Intellsat, Juno, MCI, Milstar, MSV, MUOS. NPOESS, Omegasat, P1196, P-81, SMMA, SMU, Spaceway, Tempo, Virgo, XPC Commercial and Scientific Projects  AEi Systems' power supply analysis and design expertise has also been sought for commercial and industrial projects not involving space or defense. For example, AEi Systems worked on the following projects (we can name): The upgrading and revision of the failing design of the LVPS power supply for the Atlas Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator that ""uncovered"" the Higgs Boson) Darwin (Schilling Robotics), a 100kW Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle (ROV) that operates underneath the North Sea under 17 kPSI at over 6 kM; and  Commercial projects for Bosch, DeLL and EMC. SPICE Modeling AEi Systems provides SPICE models to many major IC manufacturers, including Texas Instruments, ON Semiconductor and National Semiconductor. Many can be seen on (and downloaded from) their websites.  Since 2005, this business unit has produced and distributed the Power IC Model Library for PSpice, which is distributed by Cadence's sole North American distributor (EMA-EDA) in the United States and Canada, and by other major distributors in Asia and Europe.",Active,For Profit,,,1995-01-01,year,Aerospace

The standard slotted flaps and the swept back wingtip floats (sponsons) create an extraordinary ground effect, cushions the touchdown, and speeds the lift-off on water and land.  Low speed stability is excellent.  Never before has an amphibian offered so much comfort.  The Seawind has the widest cabin in its class, with the standard executive deluxe four-place configuration or the optional family five-place seating.  The seats are bucket-style adjustable with temper foam for ultimate comfort.  The special designed seats have passed the stringent 26g forward and 19g - 60°up vertical crash tests. The wrap-around windshield offers a spectacular panoramic view even for the aft seats. Whether the mission is a business meeting in the city or a fishing trip into the wilderness, or cross country travel, the Seawind fills the bill.  The Seawind is the only plane that fulfills every customer’s needs.",Active,For Profit,Equity Crowdfunding,,2009-04-01,day,"Aerospace, Hospitality, Manufacturing, Transportation, Travel"

Our key technological differentiators include a unique solid propellant rocket engine that is throttleable, stoppable, and in-flight restartable; as well as a pressure stabilized ""inflatable"" vehicle design. Combined with the pressure stabilized vehicle, the engine allows for incredibly high propellant mass fractions.  The engine and propellant design dramatically improves safety while reducing launch costs. In order to monetize this new industry which we are creating, we will make most of our money through propellant sales; as repeat business is the most reliable revenue stream. Several years ago we started with a handful of novel ideas and began prototyping.  Today we have an engine system, two full scale vehicles in testing, and a portfolio of patentable, patent pending, and patented technology. Our next step is to enter the DARPA Launch Challenge (we have already perqualified), where we will be given $400K to continue development, and up to $12M more if we make our orbital launch goals.",Active,For Profit,Non-equity Assistance,,2007-01-01,day,"Aerospace, Space Travel"

Or skip the meeting altogether, and be on the slopes in Tahoe by 8:40 AM for $100 round-trip, and back home the same evening. We are a land of towns and communities, many with airports, but few with regular air service. Our stock of 13,500 airports is the largest in the world, yet just 140 of the largest hubs carry over 97% of air traffic. This has left many of us with long drives to catch a flight, while on shorter trips we skip air travel altogether. Communities without good air service also struggle to attract investment and create jobs. Electric aircraft of varying sizes are ideally suited to this critical need, requiring little support other than a GPS flight path and a quick recharge or swap facility on the tarmac. Be it Moses Lake, Beaumont, Santa Fe or Butte: prepare for the convenience of frequent electric air service. Did you know that short-haul flights produce over 40% of aviation emissions? With our aircraft, we believe these will be largely eliminated within twenty years.
