- Small ideas

We should focus on one feature/one page web apps that are related to 1) mathematics of finance 2) everyday life 3) VC-related (???)

Not quite sure on the third thing. Maybe something that can speed up due dilegence procedures? But I mean - why would anyone use it. Who would upload sensitive information to a random website lol (some poeple would I guess but still).


1) VC side - LLM chat box that is trained on VC research data to spit out VC research.
2) Math/Finance side - finance sentiment analyzer. so analyze news and social media (basically "motion of words" as long as it's from a person).
3) everyday - does apple maps have a plugin? would be cool to plugin LIVE nyc public transport animations. like you open your maps and you see the L train at the station before you even click into the station. Or a bus coming or something IDK LOL
4) Math/Finance side - crypto investment simulator. this webapp would allow users to construct their own crypto portfolio with fake money and track their performance. Could be a learning tool.
5) alternative data insights for crypto / VCs? this one is a bit tricky. but basically how could you use alternative data like foot traffick to determine upcoming sales trends for your portfolio company (if you are a VC). another use case on the VC side, utilizing foot traffic to beaches during the summer to determine how many people would potentially buy sunscreen product sold by your portfolio company. I am not sure what this would look like on the cryptoside......but just anything other than standard financial news. for example - maybe for crypto it could be analyzing regulatory sentiment. So like this essentiallly - https://www.bcmstrategy2.com/. Now that I think about it idk if this should be in the small ideas section...
6) Shit and learn: a simple webpage that asks what news sites you have subscribed to and that automatically generates a summary of a list of recent news articles that can be consumed in 10 minutes--aka time while one is relieving oneself. Uses chatgpt.
7) A web app that asks the user for five songs and that generates a playlist of 100 songs similar to those songs. The generated playlist could be downloaded with Spotify and Apple Music. Requires using the API of those two as well as chatgpt.

- Big ideas: 

For these bigger ideas (start mid-Summer)

We should focus on two things first: ideation then validation. So research the focus areas, then move to consumer research. So that's cold emails/calls with experts/target bodies. Purpose is to find opportunity areas and pain points if there are any at all. If there are none, we save ourselves any effort and time in building something. that's why we focus on building small ideas to show that we can actually build period, and focus on building big ideas that actually will be used. I don't care if no one uses our webapps that we spent five days working on. But if I spend a year working on a big idea, it better make someone's life easier lol.

Launch beta by EOY. This will be open-source at first...

Everything else doesn't matter post-beta honestly. If we get that far it's an accomplishment in my opinion.

Tech transfer web portal that tracks IP and transactions.

Email portal that looks exactly like iMessage lol.

This is worth taking a look at. AR filter development at tiktok pays out $700/500000 unique video. https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/
- Let's say our goal is 7K profit from AR filters we built.
- Aim is 4Million unique videos using the filter PER filter (not aggregated by all filters created).
- Effectively the costs are 0 for building these, but additionally its requiried to garner the views @ 90 days.
- If we pay creators with DOUBLE the required unique view count, so 10M+ followers (I was on tiktok in 2020 and that didn't seem that crazy back then so Im sure there are a lot of people like that). Let's we create 5 AR filters every 90 days. we pay creators $200 total to make videos with our filter.
Assuming each AR vid generates .5M unique videos (which is bold).
$700*5 = 3500 Revenue.
$200*5 = 1000$ COST
2500 profit every 90 days?

Real revenue formula is P = ($700*Q)+(140 x N) - C

With Q being AR filter/effect reaching 500,000 unique posts witihin 90 days.
With N being each 100,000 additional posts achieved within 90 days.
With C being cost. Cost could be paying creators to post to gain more traction. Maybe we could outsource. Otherwise the only other cost to consider is time.

On the oursourcing we would have to pay by the hour. Let's say we give someone 1000$. That's 100 hours to develop some great effects if they get paid $10 hour.

- a webapp that allows users to write thesis/opinions/guesses/theorize on quantifiable outcomes - a bet essentially - but instead of providing money, the platform would award the user with some sort of point system. So betting for clout essentially. And then have the user ranked.


For example: people love to make theories on entertainment. movies, tv shows, sports (i.e. the Golden State Warriors will win by X amount in the 3 leg of their playoffs, I predict the One Piece will be X). Some people will even wait for an outcome to be decided, and then tell their friends they knew X was going to happen all along. **What this platform does is simply hold individuals accountable for their convictions - rewards them with social recognition for being write and punishes them for being wrong**

So how would this platform work functionally. I guess users could come in, and we would have to create some sort of form for them to place their predictions on. Then we have to have this form digest the information and place it into categories. Once outcomes are decided, we have to note them (probably manually), and reward users. Reward users on being right, reward them for their thought process and how right their thinking was.

- Cool areas: entertainment (sports, tv, movies), finance (private and public market predictions), politics (war, elections), macro data (population trends).

- Cool functions: create profiles for celebrities. Stephen A. Smith predicted warriors to lose in the first stage of playoffs, punish him for being wrong on the site. Donald Trump says there is gonna be a "yyuuuuuge red wave" puninsh him for being wrong.
- Cool functions: rank boards per topic. rank boards for basketball, baseball, anime, fast and furious. rank boards public vs. friends.

protein folding webapp: utilize AlphaFold for protein prediction and ChatGPT for interpretation.
- Input: User enters a protein sequence into web application.
- Visualization: Once prediction is completed, 3d structure is visualized.
- Explanation: considering inputs and prediction, chatgpt explains details in a chatbox, user can ask follow-up questions.
- Advanced Features: Allow user to modify protein sequence - see how it impacts predicted structure.
