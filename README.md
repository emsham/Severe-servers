- Small ideas

We should focus on one feature/one page web apps that are related to 1) mathematics of finance 2) everyday life 3) VC-related (???)

Not quite sure on the third thing. Maybe something that can speed up due dilegence procedures? But I mean - why would anyone use it. Who would upload sensitive information to a random website lol (some poeple would I guess but still).


1) VC side - LLM chat box that is trained on VC research data to spit out VC research.
2) Math/Finance side - finance sentiment analyzer. so analyze news and social media (basically "motion of words" as long as it's from a person).
3) everyday - does apple maps have a plugin? would be cool to plugin LIVE nyc public transport animations. like you open your maps and you see the L train at the station before you even click into the station. Or a bus coming or something IDK LOL
4) Math/Finance side - crypto investment simulator. this webapp would allow users to construct their own crypto portfolio with fake money and track their performance. Could be a learning tool.
5) alternative data insights for crypto / VCs? this one is a bit tricky. but basically how could you use alternative data like foot traffick to determine upcoming sales trends for your portfolio company (if you are a VC). another use case on the VC side, utilizing foot traffic to beaches during the summer to determine how many people would potentially buy sunscreen product sold by your portfolio company. I am not sure what this would look like on the cryptoside......but just anything other than standard financial news. for example - maybe for crypto it could be analyzing regulatory sentiment. So like this essentiallly - https://www.bcmstrategy2.com/. Now that I think about it idk if this should be in the small ideas section...

- Big ideas: 

For these bigger ideas (start mid-Summer)

We should focus on two things first: ideation then validation. So research the focus areas, then move to consumer research. So that's cold emails/calls with experts/target bodies. Purpose is to find opportunity areas and pain points if there are any at all. If there are none, we save ourselves any effort and time in building something. that's why we focus on building small ideas to show that we can actually build period, and focus on building big ideas that actually will be used. I don't care if no one uses our webapps that we spent five days working on. But if I spend a year working on a big idea, it better make someone's life easier lol.

Launch beta by EOY. This will be open-source at first...

Everything else doesn't matter post-beta honestly. If we get that far it's an accomplishment in my opinion.
