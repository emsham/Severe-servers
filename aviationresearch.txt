digital solutions for aviation:


this is one of the big ideas and I genuinely think the scheduling one is just the easiest to do. other two ideas require aviation experience (technical and otherwise) so forget it.

Gonna quickly gather all aerospace and air transportation companies built in United States history.

Okay I compiled all companies from Crunchbase into one csv file. Honestly a lot of data but good to have. Didn't take a deep dive but I was checking out aviation software n google essentially related to scheduling. All scheduling has to do with maintence and stuff. Like work orders and what not. Operational efficiency is the key here.

Honestly with this, it would be best to do some cold calls and find out pain points that way.
